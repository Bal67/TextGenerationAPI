# Attribution and Use of AI Tools

This project, **TextGenerationAPI**, leverages LLM-based API calls to generate text using Amazon Bedrock. Its development incorporated support from AI-assisted tools and libraries to expedite coding, testing, and documentation tasks.

## Tools and Services Used

- **ChatGPT by OpenAI (GPT-4o)**: Contributed to:
  - Debugging Python modules and REST API logic
  - Designing and refining Bedrock prompts
  - Improving error handling and logging strategies
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Used for interacting with:
  - **Anthropic Claude** for generating natural language responses via API
- **FastAPI**: Employed for building the backend API
- **boto3**: Utilized for AWS Bedrock integration

## AI Contributions

- Helped design modular API routes and parameter validation
- Optimized Claude prompt formatting and request handling
- Suggested CI/test structures and edge case handling

## Authorship Statement

All AI-generated content was reviewed and adapted by the project author. The final implementation, including security practices and deployment considerations, was designed and validated independently. AI tools were used as development aids.
